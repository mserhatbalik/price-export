# price-export specific (if you want to ignore your data/output files by pattern)
# For example, if you don't want to commit any .csv or .xlsx files:
# *.csv
# *.xlsx
# However, be careful with this. If 'price_data.csv' is your primary input data
# you might want to commit it, unless it's very large or changes too frequently.
# The Excel file 'price_data.xlsx' is generated by the script, so it's often good to ignore.
